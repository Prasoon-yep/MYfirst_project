                <p class="text-justify">Description
                    Momos are small, dough-wrapped pockets that are typically filled with spiced meat or vegetables. The
                    dough is made from flour, water, and salt, and the dumplings are sealed by twisting the edges of the
                    dough. Momos are usually served with a sauce, chutney, or pickle. It is generally believed that the
                    concept of dumplings was carried from China by the Mongols in the 13th century.[13][7][6] As for the
                    Himalayan momo, similar to the history of Korean mandu, the history of momos in Nepal dates back to
                    as early as the fourteenth century.[14][15] It is not quite known whether it spread from the
                    Kathmandu valley of Nepal to Tibet or the other way around. Because this dish was initially popular
                    among the Newar community of the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal, one prevalent belief is that traveling
                    Nepali Newar merchants took the recipe from Tibet, where they traded, and brought it home to
                    Nepal.[16] Some argue that momos were introduced in Tibet by a Nepalese Newari princess who was
                    married to a Tibetan king in the late fifteenth century. since in the Newar language, mome (Newar:
                    рдордо) means cooking by steaming.[15] In Tibet, the filling of the dish was typically meat, such as yak
                    and occasionally potatoes and cheese. Traditional Tibetan momos are quite different from the
                    Nepalese one as the former was made with a thicker dough and with little to no spices except
                    salt.After arriving in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, the meat was more often chicken, and mixed
                    vegetable momos were introduced to feed the large population of vegetarian Hindus.[17] A large
                    number of Tibetans emigrated to India following the 1959 Tibetan uprising, bringing their recipes
                    for momos with them.[3] Unproven, but substantiated by the dates and references to momos in
                    colloquial references, the civil war in Nepal pushed out the Nepali diaspora to seek a livelihood in
                    India, which further increased the prevalence of Himalayan style momos in the southern half of India
                    especially in the cities of Chennai and Bangalore.
